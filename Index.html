<h1>Remote learning leaves some students behind</h1>
<h2>By Sarah Molano. October 5, 2020.</h2>


  <p style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:black; padding: 1em;">As school reopening plans in New York City continue to change, thousands of students are getting accustomed to working remotely. About 50.2 percent of students in the city are attending classes fully remotely — that's over half a million students. On the days that students are remote learning, parents are scrambling for ways to support their children's virtual learning while having to go to work themselves. <br>
  <br>Some of these difficulties are obvious: the need for childcare for young children when parents go off to work, keeping children engaged in school virtually, creating an environment at home that is conducive to learning and so on. But some of these issues are not so plainly in sight.</p>

    <span><strong><em>More than 500,000 households</em></strong> in New York City lack internet access. In the world of remote learning, this obviously serves as a serious obstacle for students. Aside from internet access, many households also lack multiple computers or devices for online school — a problem for families with more than one child doing remote learning. </span>

    <span><strong><em>About 10 percent of students</em></strong> in New York City public schools are homeless, with 21,000 children sleeping in shelters across the city. Most homeless shelters do not have internet for children to do remote learning, and many don't even have adequate cell service to utilize mobile hotspots. Homelessness has already been known to disrupt children's ability to succeed academically, and the added stress of online learning only creates another barrier.</span>

    <span><strong><em>More than 1 million residents</em></strong> of New York City live in food insecure households. Thousands of students get one or two of their daily meals from school, but with remote learning, families struggle to provide nutritious meals to their children. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, more than half of all public school students rely on the federal government to provide free or reduced price lunch. </span>

    <span><strong><em>There are 228,000 students</em></strong> in New York City with disabilities who have to adapt to remote learning. These students often require additional hands-on help in the classroom, so remote learning presents a unique set of challenges for them. Further, without consistent specialized help, disabled children are at high risk of falling behind in their education.</span>
